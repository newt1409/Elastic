# signatures(_carved).log is different, as it comes from file carving and is
# "live" regardless of whether the other *.log files that may be processed
# after the fact. The most important difference is close_eof, as
# we don't want to close signatures(_carved).log when we get to the end of the
# file as it will likely be written to again shortly. For these reasons we
# exclude it in the main filebeat log input (see above) and handle it with
# custom settings here.
